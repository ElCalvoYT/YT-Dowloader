# YouTube Video Downloader

A simple, standalone application for downloading YouTube videos in the highest available quality. This application is packaged as an executable, so you donâ€™t need to worry about installing Python or any additional libraries.

## Features

- Download YouTube videos in the highest quality available.
- Specify the directory where you want to save the downloaded videos.

## Downloading the Executable

1. **Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/ElCalvoYT/YT-Dowloader/releases) Page**:
   - Navigate to the Releases section of this repository to download the latest version of the executable.

2. **Download the ZIP File**:
   - Find the release version you want (e.g., `v1.0.0 - Initial Release`).
   - Download the ZIP file, which contains the executable and necessary files.

## Using the Executable

1. **Extract the ZIP File**:
   - Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.

2. **Run the Executable**:
   - Open a command prompt or terminal window.
   - Navigate to the directory where you extracted the ZIP file.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/extracted/zip
   ```

   - Run the executable with the following command:

   ```bash
   ./yt-downloader.exe <YouTube URL> <Output Directory>
   ```

   - Replace `<YouTube URL>` with the URL of the video you want to download.
   - Replace `<Output Directory>` with the path where you want to save the downloaded video.

   **Example**:

   ```bash
   ./yt-downloader.exe https://youtu.be/X2Njs8jv_yk .
   ```

   This command will download the video and save it in the current directory.

## Requirements

- No Python or additional libraries are required; everything is bundled in the executable.

## Troubleshooting

- **Executable Does Not Run**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the file. On Windows, you may need to unblock the file by right-clicking it, selecting "Properties," and then checking "Unblock" under the General tab.
- **Error Messages**: Ensure you are using the correct URL format and that the output directory exists or can be created.
